# RegEx
This demonstrates how you can use regular expressions in the different project in the packages

Create a program that validates user input using regexes for the following properƟ es: 
o Name – LeƩ ers and Spaces only 
o Email Address 
o Mobile Number – Must either start with 254,07,01 or +254, and with the appropriate 
length 
 Create a program that reads one of your Java files, and prints out all the methods and properƟ es 
which have private access, using regexes. 
 Create a program that reads the file provided ‘workflow-approval.html’, and prints out all the 
variables that are in []. E.g. This is a [SAMPLE] text that is a [STRING]. The program needs to print 
out [SAMPLE] and [STRING]. The brackets are inclusive in the output
